## Roadmap (23/07/2026)

Engine 1.0 was tagged as `v1.0.0` on 23/07/2026. Content track is now open:

1. Keep engine parity fixes auditable against the `v1.0.0` baseline.
2. Release new classes, areas, and quests as content versions on top of that
   stable engine.

## Platform

- Save optimisation (probe data in docs/PERFORMANCE.md sec. Save path):
  add debug-gated `ticks()` instrumentation to
  `_serialize_world` ("save" DBG channel); the cache conversion is
  also the alloc diet, and dropping the up-front `gc_collect()`
  returns 78-198 ms. HVars and file I/O measured negligible.
- 6mb-vs-8mb app scaffolding question is closed: 8 MB is fully backable
  and healthy on the G1 (mem_soak); Connectivity Kit needs the Python
  app closed (reset) regardless of heap size.
